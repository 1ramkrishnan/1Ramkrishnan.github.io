      rklab is my homegrown HomeLab server setup, running right from my home. It combines Raspberry Pi clusters and repurposed Linux machines to power cloud storage, network monitoring, local AI, crypto mining, home media entertainment, and more. A 24/7 digital playground, crafted just for me! ðŸ˜‰
